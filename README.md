We chose to do project number 2 which is about a Augmented Reality for Smart Room. We will be creating a 
application that is compatible with the devices inside the MDU Smart Room with the mentioned required features written on canvas
which are: 

- The app displays augmented reality overlay over static elements in the room without QR codes
and with one mobile element in the room using the QR code.
- The app can read data from the systems in the room.
- The app can be used to change the state of at least one device in the smart room.

The Smart Room is filled with different data used for applications like ours, as mentioned in canvas we will be using the Web-based API that is available in the Smart Room to access the data thats in there. The API is specifically used to access the data in the Smart Room and to send commands back to the actuators in the room. 

## App Design

The design is made with figma and can be found [here](https://www.figma.com/file/1INVmuHwCh3D0wGTAYFtDu/AR-APP?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=EEWJhAXmKXIf2EL5-1).
